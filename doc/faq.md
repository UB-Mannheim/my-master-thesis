## Is there a Wikibook on LaTeX?

[There certainly is](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX)

## How can I add the bibliography section to the table of contents?

If you want to include a line for the bibliography in your table of content,
then you can try `\addcontentsline` (see [here](http://www.weinelt.de/latex/addcontentsline.html)).

## I don't have any output profiles configured in TeXnicCenter

If your MikTeX installation was don afterwards or is in some special order
then the automatic detection step in TeXnicCenter might fail and there is no
output profile (e.g. LaTeX => PDF) but this list is just blank.

Try then:

1. Go to `Build` then `Define Output Profile` and start the `Wizard...` again.
1. Skip the optional things like postscript and see if this already works.
1. If the MikTeX path cannot be found by this wizard, then you are asked to enter that
by hand. This can be the case when you have installed MikTeX not for all users but
only for the current user. Start to look for the `MiKTeX/2.9/miktex/bin` directory
in the folder `C:\Users\{YOUR_USER_NAME}\AppData\Roaming`, copy this path and try again.

## Installing packages on-the-fly in TeXnicCenter does not work

For the more advanced exercises you need special packages, e.g. `tex\context\base\supp-pdf.mkii`
for `\include{graphicx}`. If you don't have these packages installed locally then
it is possible that during the build process in TeXnicCenter [you are asked to install
this package on-the-fly](https://i.stack.imgur.com/b1b0y.png). After a successful installation
this dialog should not appear any more. However, it is possible that this dialog
apears again and again and the installation always produces some errors.

In this case you should try to use the `MiKTeX Package Manager` (maybe also as Administrator),
see also [here](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/49338/miktex-2-9-install-packages-on-the-fly)
and [here](http://latex-community.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9034).

## TeXnicCenter gives an error "Cannot execute command"

If you are getting an error message "Cannot execute command" from TeXnicCenter
after trying to view your pdf file with Acrobat, adjust the output profile
settings, see how to  [configure PDF Viewer in the Windows installation guide](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/sci-work-course/blob/master/doc/install-windows.md#configure-pdf-viewer-optional)

## Texmaker gives "command not found" errors

Set up the absolute paths to the tools.

## How can I find LaTeX commands for symbols by drawing them?

Try [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html).

## What is the difference between \centering and the `center` environment

See [Difference between `\centering` and `\begin{center}...\end{center}`](http://texblog.net/latex-archive/layout/center-centering/)

## How do I specify multiple authors in BibTeX?

Different authors have to be seperated by "and" in the author-field. A comma
will be used to seperate last name and first name. A semicolon will be just
looked as any text. Moreover, this often lead to errors like "too many comas".

## How can I change the font size?

> The standard classes, article, report and book support 3 different font sizes, 10pt, 11pt, 12pt (by default 10pt)." 

(see [here](http://texblog.org/2012/08/29/changing-the-font-size-in-latex/) for a nice explanation).

## Error: Cannot determine size of graphic

When the `\includegraphics` gives an error for your picture and tells you that no
bounding box is found, then you can either
* use another image or image format
* mention explicitely the bounding box in LaTeX, i.e. for an image named `pic.jpg`
with width 1280 and height 960:
```latex
\includegraphics[bb=0 0 1280 960]{pic.jpg}
```

## How can I make newlines or multiple lines in cells of some tabular?

This is for example needed if otherwise the text in a column is too wide for the page size.
The easiest is to use `p{'width'}` for such columns in the tabular specification, and possibly
use in such columns then also `\newline`, e.g.
```tex
\begin{tabular}{cp{11cm}}
1 & blabla\\
2 & blabla blabla blabla\newline blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla blabla 
\end{tabular}
```
