## Introduction

To use LaTeX, you need two pieces of software:

* A LaTeX distribution
* A LaTeX editor

The distribution contains all the tools, libraries, documentation and styles
that you will need for creating documents. A good editor makes writing and invoking
the necessary commands to build a PDF from the LaTeX/BibTeX sources trivial.

We recommend:

* [MacTeX Distribution](https://tug.org/mactex/). It is rather large (~2.9 GiB) but complete and up-to-date.
* [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/). Free software, cross-platform, easy to configure yet powerful.

## Installation

### homebrew

If you have [Homebrew]() installed (which we highly recommend), you can install
both MacTeX and TeXstudio from the command line. Open a terminal (search
`terminal` in Launchpad) and execute these two commands:

```
brew cask install mactex
brew cask install texstudio
```

### Downloaded packages

#### MacTeX

Go to the [MacTeX Distribution](https://tug.org/mactex/) website in Safari and click download:

![Mactex Website Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UB-Mannheim/ubma-screenshots/master/sci-work/macosx/macosx-mactex-download.png)

This should open a new page with the mirror used:

![Mactex Website Download 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UB-Mannheim/ubma-screenshots/master/sci-work/macosx/macosx-mactex-download2.png)

If the download isn't starting, reload this page until you hit a working mirror.

Once download has finished, open `Downloads` in Finder and click on the
`mactex-20150613.pkg` file.

The default options for the installation are fine.

MacTeX is Free Software, there are no traps lurking in the license screen.

Click the Download button to download the installation file.

Open `Downloads` in Finder. Open `texstudio-VERSION-osx.dmg` and drag `texstudio.app` to the Applications folder in Finder (you might have to open a new Finder window via the menu or using `cmd + N`).

Add the TeXstudio icon to the dock so you'll find it later.

## Verify Installation

Create a new folder and download the files
[testDocument.tex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UB-Mannheim/sci-work-course/master/doc/LatexExample/testDocument.tex)
and
[references.bib](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UB-Mannheim/sci-work-course/master/doc/LatexExample/references.bib)
(right click and `Save link target`).

Open the `testDocument.tex` file in TeXstudio.

Compile the Document by pressing `F5` or click the left green arrow on the
toolbar.

The document created should match [goal.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UB-Mannheim/sci-work-course/master/doc/LatexExample/goal.pdf).
